# Music-based-AI-Powered-Rhythm-Game
The project aims to create a Unity-based game where players can import their favorite music tracks and engage in a dynamic 4-button piano gameplay experience. Utilizing advanced AI and digital signal processing (DSP) techniques, the game analyzes the imported music to generate rhythmic patterns and melodies that align with the song's tempo and key.
